            <p>As a family company, we set out to create a product that addressed our personal concerns when washing our clothes at home in Denmark. We soon learned that these same concerns are shared by millions of people around the world. </p>
            <p>With this in mind, our mission was clear from the beginning. We want to provide a detergent for everyday use that delivers clean, fresh, soft clothes, whilst being safe, planet-friendly and less costly than using three separate products.</p>
            <p>We have worked hard to create a product that performs in the way you need it to, whilst addressing the fact that every one of us must do our bit to contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

                <p>At 7 wash, we’re proud to be a family company. We understand the challenges of day-to-day life and that most families want to work towards a more sustainable future. We also know that making sure your laundry is clean, fresh and soft is really important. </p>
                <p>Our founder and Chief Dirt Fighter is Mads Christoffersen. Since 1992, he has been working on creating water and plant-based printing inks in Denmark, in order to reduce the environmental impact of the printing industry. He has two kids who are in sports, and back in times when the idea came up to him, they were training almost every day so the washing machine was always (and still) spinning!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                As a professional Mads knew that most commercially-available laundry detergents, stain removers and fabric softeners contain harsh chemicals and additives that can damage our health and contribute to the destruction of the planet.
                </p>
                <p> So, he began work on creating a laundry detergent that would tackle dirt and odours and deliver incredible softness, but without the impact on the environment or his family’s wellbeing. After extensive lab research in his home country of Denmark, 7 wash was born.</p>
